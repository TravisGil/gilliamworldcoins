The coins were originally the same types as circulating coinage but in the late-18th century they developed into soecially-designed pieces, though they retained their legal tender status. Maundy money no longer circulates due to its silver content and numismatic value. A small sum of ordinary money is also given in lieu of gifts of clothing and food.',
